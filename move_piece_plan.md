in Chess#move_piece

case statement - find out what piece moves
  pawn:
  get square that pawn moves to
  if there is a pawn in the next square, move that pawn
  else move the pawn 2 squares, if legal
  else error invalid move and redo
  
OK gotta refactor board i think
its way too complicated
want to be able to move/swap pieces by typing:
board[pos] = board[old_pos
NM GOTTA THINK
